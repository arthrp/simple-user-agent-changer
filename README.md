# Simple User Agent changer

Dead simple Chrome extension that allows you to modify User Agent header. Should work in all browsers that support Chrome extensions (v2).

## Why does it look so ugly?

Design is inspired by [this](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) legendary website.

## Why create yet another extension to change User Agent?

There are [plenty](https://chromewebstore.google.com/search/user%20agent) extensions available for this purpose, but in this one the extension iself (scripts, manifest, markdown, stylesheet combined) is less than the license file (35 kb).
